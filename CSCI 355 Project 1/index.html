                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <h2>I am a student at Queens College of the City University of New York, currently completing my degree
                    with a major in Computer Science.
                    My primary focus is on pursuing a career in Cybersecurity and Software Engineering.
                    I also have experience in IT support and data analysis, complemented by a background in business
                    through various coursework.</h2>
                <h2>I have a wide range of passions and hobbies, all rooted in a common drive:
                    the desire to understand complex systems by breaking them down into their fundamental components to
                    achieve something greater.
                    For example, in Magic The Gathering, there's a specific combination of cards that, when used in the
                    correct order, can simulate a basic calculation engine or become a logic puzzle.
                    This kind of logical construction fascinates me as from a young age I enjoyed deconstructing and
                    learning new things
                    about the world around me. It's a curiosity that naturally led me to technology.
                </h2>

                <h3>I couldn't get the photo gallery to work so I will leave a note here as I wanted to make a section for the images of myself, interests, and socially but will leave an image of myself because I wanted to show I know how to add images</h3>
                <h2 id="About">I am a beleiver in board games as a social engine to help people connect with each other as well as allow for a sense of community.
                    Technology has allowed the world to be more interconnected and accessible than ever before, however it has also been a source of isolation and loneliness.
                    I hope to help bridge this gap by creating a platform that allows people to connect with each other and share their passions.
